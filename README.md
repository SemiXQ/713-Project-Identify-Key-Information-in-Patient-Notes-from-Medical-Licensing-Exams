# Identify Key Information in Patient Notes from Medical Licensing Exams
This a course project for CMPT 713 NLP course. In this project, we proposed two different solutions to a Kaggle competition ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nbme-score-clinical-patient-notes/overview)), and we experimented the two solutions with DistilBERT and ELECTRA models separaterly, in which our best model achieves 84.75% overall accuracy.

We also proposed evaluation metrics to analyze the models' performance to reveal data insights. For the analysis results, please check the report. :)
